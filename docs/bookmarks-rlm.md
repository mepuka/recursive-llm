### 1. Daytona's RLM Guide

> We just dropped our guide to Recursive Language Models.
> Where every agent and sub-agent gets its own @daytonaio sandbox - at UNLIMITED recursion depth 🤯

### 2. Tips for RLM-like Coding Agents
**@lateinteraction** — Feb 6, 2026

> Tips for coding agents to be more RLM-like:
> 1) Don't read context into prompts. Read context into variables!
> 2) Don't call sub-agents as direct tools that pollute your context window with I/O. Write...

### 3. DSPy RLM Implementation
**@mchonedev** — Jan 20, 2026

> The @DSPy team did some AMAZING work bringing RLMs to the framework. After getting a chance to look at it, I have a few thoughts.
> I was asked: "How is RLM different than what claude code does?" and...

### 4. Future Model Harnesses
**@voooooogel** — Jan 27, 2026

> Some thoughts and speculation on future model harnesses. It's fun to make jokes about gas town and other complicated orchestrators, and similarly probably correct to imagine most of what they offer...

### 5. The True Nature of Agents
**@deepfates** — Feb 6, 2026

> In my quest to understand the true nature of an Agent I have been thinking a lot about the loop and the actions and the environment. And I think i see where we're headed next.
> Agents are not going to...

## Summary

**Key themes from bookmarks:**

1. **Sandboxed recursion** — Daytona's approach gives each agent/sub-agent its own isolated sandbox, enabling unlimited recursion depth without context pollution

2. **Context hygiene** — @lateinteraction's tips emphasize keeping context clean: read into variables (not prompts), don't pollute context window with sub-agent I/O

3. **DSPy integration** — The DSPy framework now has RLM support, with discussion of how it differs from Claude Code's approach

4. **Orchestration evolution** — Movement away from complex orchestrators toward cleaner recursive patterns
