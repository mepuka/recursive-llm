Currently, Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) are only legal in five pilot areas in Chicago, which were established May 1, 2022. Since the pilot areas were established, 106 permits totaling 134 units have been issued. On October 26, 2022, 15 Chicago city council members filed an ordinance that would allow ADUs citywide.  Action item  Sign our petition today and tell Chicago City Council to support ADUs citywide! ADUs are a climate-friendly step towards solving the nation's housing crisis while reducing exclusionary zoning and supporting high-paying construction jobs.  Accessory Dwelling Unit Context  Accessory dwelling units, also known as coach houses or granny flats, are an important tool for addressing the housing and climate crises. These types of housing units were typically legal before the widespread adoption of single-family zoning in cities, and provided affordable housing options to residents and an additional income stream for homeowners. Now, with housing costs skyrocketing across the United States, many cities and states are re-legalizing ADUs.   Maxable     ADU benefits:   Naturally affordable housing - provides a new housing option for young adults, retirees, and small families  Aging in place - elderly individuals can downsize while staying close to family and friends in their neighborhood  Multigenerational households - have family support nearby, while maintaining personal spaces  Rental income - an additional income stream can help prevent the displacement of low-income homeowners and retirees on fixed income  Gentle density - provides new housing in existing neighborhoods without impacting its appearance   Climate-friendly - building new homes in existing neighborhoods reduces demand for sprawling, greenfield development. New construction ADUs are also highly efficient and often all-electric, leveraging technologies such as heat pumps and induction ranges.   ADU success stories:   In Los Angeles, ADUs now make up 1 in 4 new homes (5,064 permitted in 2021 alone)  Since ADU reform was passed in 2016, ADU construction has boomed in California, and now makes up approximately 12% of all new homes permitted.   ADU share of all new home permits issued (Bay Area and California)   Bay Area Council    Current ADU pilot areas   Chicago Cityscape","url":"https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/support-adus-citywide-in-chicago"}}
